# Getting AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

[AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner) exam is a must for anyone who is starting their AWS journey. Non-technical folks can gain basic knowledge about AWS working and various terms and technologies. Technical folks wanting to get either Developer or Solutions Architect would save money by giving both exams as this exam costs $100 but then reduces $150 from the next exam you take.
